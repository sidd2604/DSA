# Daily DSA Problems — LeetCode · GeeksForGeeks · Codeforces

Welcome to a personal collection of daily Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) problems and solutions. This repo contains curated problems from LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, Codeforces, and other places — plus occasional hand-picked practice problems for sharpening algorithmic thinking and competitive programming skills.

Why this repo
- Practice every day: small, consistent steps beat one-off marathons.
- Learn by doing: each problem includes a solution and notes for clarity.
- Multi-source collection: problems from LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, Codeforces, and extras.

What to expect
- Daily posts: new problems are added regularly (date-prefixed filenames for easy navigation).
- Clear solutions: concise, well-commented code with the chosen language for each problem.
- Problem variety: arrays, strings, trees, graphs, DP, greedy, math, and more.

How this repo is organized
- `Leetcode/` — Solutions and notes for LeetCode problems.
- `GeeksForGeeks/` — GfG practice problems and solutions.
- `CodeForces/` — Competitive programming problems and contest solutions.
- Filenames commonly follow `Mon_DD_YYYY.cpp` or `YYYY_MM_DD_problemname.ext` style for quick date-based browsing.

History
I started contributing daily problems last year (January–February), paused for a bit, and now I’m back with a plan to post consistently every day. Expect steady updates and gradual growth of the archive.

Contributing
- Found a bug or improved solution? Open a pull request with a clear title and short description.
- Add tests or alternative explanations to help others learn.
- Keep code formatting consistent and include language and problem source in the filename or top comment.

Suggested contribution steps
1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a branch named `add/<source>-<date>-<short-name>`.
3. Add your solution and a short description in the file header.
4. Open a pull request with a concise summary and why it helps.

Daily format (suggested)
- Problem header with source (e.g., LeetCode #1234) and difficulty.
- Short explanation of approach (2–4 lines).
- Clean solution code with comments and time/space complexity notes.
